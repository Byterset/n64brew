So, for example, to color a surface using primitive color you would turn off the G\+\_\+\+SHADE, G\+\_\+\+SHADING\+\_\+\+SMOOTH and G\+\_\+\+LIGHTING flags. Then, as explained in the next section, by setting the combine mode to G\+\_\+\+CC\+\_\+\+PRIMITIVE you can add color using primitive color.

To color a surface using vertex color, you turn on G\+\_\+\+SHADE and turn off G\+\_\+\+LIGHTING. Then if G\+\_\+\+SHADING\+\_\+\+SMOOTH is turned off, flat shading is performed, and if it is turned on, smooth shading is performed.

For lighting, you turn on both G\+\_\+\+SHADE and G\+\_\+\+LIGHTING. As with vertex color, if G\+\_\+\+SHADING\+\_\+\+SMOOTH is turned off, then flat shading is used for rendering, and if it is turned on, then smooth shading is used.\hypertarget{md_docs_GRAPHICS_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{combine mode}\label{md_docs_GRAPHICS_autotoc_md12}

G\+\_\+\+CC\+\_\+\+PRIMITIVE\+: Output primitive color (shading/lighting \& texture are ignored) G\+\_\+\+CC\+\_\+\+SHADE\+: Output shading color (texture is ignored) G\+\_\+\+CC\+\_\+\+DECALRGB\+: only texture is used (shading/lighting is ignored) G\+\_\+\+CC\+\_\+\+MODULATERGB\+: Multiply texture color and shading color
