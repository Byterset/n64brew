This ist based off of \href{https://github.com/jsdf/goose64}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/jsdf/goose64}}. This aims to transform the work done by jsdf into a general purpose 3d engine for the n64.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{what has been done so far}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item build process was mostly automized and need for manual export of meshes, collision or levels has been removed
\item opengl build was removed
\item makefile was redone
\item various python scripts and tools have been adapted
\item completely overhauled the structure of the project to scale better
\item changed audio player to support wav, aiff \& ins (done by migrating to the existing solution by the amazing \href{https://github.com/lambertjamesd/}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/lambertjamesd/}})
\item added modified version of \href{https://github.com/trhodeos/spicy}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/trhodeos/spicy}} to tools to support custom rom headers (romheaders for PAL \& NTSC included in the root)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{todos}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item improve model handling, right now I feel it is too much manual work to define the model properties
\item support more collider shapes
\item optimize collision solver (right now there is some funky behaviour with the collision solver)
\item change skeletal animation to work for generalized meshes
\item switch from obj to fbx file format (likely to go hand in hand with the skeletal animation update)

\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{install the n64 sdk}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
I am using the modern n64 homebrew sdk (crashsdk) and have based the build process around that.

mac\+OS/linux instructions\+: \href{https://crashoveride95.github.io/n64hbrew/modernsdk/startoff.html}{\texttt{ https\+://crashoveride95.\+github.\+io/n64hbrew/modernsdk/startoff.\+html}}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{building the game}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
all commands should be run in the {\ttfamily root} directory of this repo

make sure your Makefile and modern.\+makefile are set up correctly to reflect the location of the sdk on your machine and the names of the compiler, linker etc binaries.

this repo contains a custom build of trhodeos\textquotesingle{} (\href{https://github.com/trhodeos}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/trhodeos}}) {\ttfamily spicy} (\href{https://github.com/Byterset/spicyhttps://github.com/Byterset/spicy}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Byterset/spicyhttps\+://github.\+com/\+Byterset/spicy}}) which is an open source replacement for nintendo\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily mild} to create ROMs. The only difference with this included {\ttfamily spicy} binary (tools/spicy/spicy) is that this version allows for custom rom headers so you can set the region, name etc of your rom.

run {\ttfamily make} to build

run {\ttfamily make clean} or {\ttfamily make clobber} to clean up the build directory and any build-\/byproducts

this produces the rom file {\ttfamily game.\+z64} which you can then run with your favorite emulator or flashcart

environment variables which affect the build\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily OPTIMIZE=1}\+: enable gcc optimization and use non-\/debug versions of sdk libraries
\item {\ttfamily ED64=1}\+: build with everdrive64 logging support (see \href{https://github.com/jsdf/ed64log}{\texttt{ ed64log}}). don\textquotesingle{}t use unless running on an everdrive64
\end{DoxyItemize}

you can also create a file called {\ttfamily localdefs.\+makefile} containing any variables to override in the build, and it will be automatically included by the makefile.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{dependencies}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item lua (mesh export)
\item python (animation export, collision export, level export)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{regenerate n64 header files for sprites}\label{md_README_autotoc_md7}
if you update any texture files\+:

make sure you have python and pillow installed


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip install pillow}

\end{DoxyCode}


then, to rebuild sprites


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./tools/sh/sprites.sh }

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{export map object data}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item open blender (or use {\ttfamily ./blender.sh} to see console output)
\item in the blender text editor editor, open and run export\+\_\+positions.\+py then open and run export\+\_\+collision\+\_\+mesh.\+py
\item see header files are created
\item this script is run automatically when running {\ttfamily make}. So after updating a .blend file the headers should be rebuilt automatically. (given the .blend file for the level is in {\ttfamily ./assets/levels/$\ast$}) 
\end{DoxyItemize}
