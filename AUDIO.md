to export sound effects
- convert audio to AIFF (big endian), 32000hz
- open and save all AIFF files in DSE.EXE to make sure they are formatted in a way that DREAM.EXE will understand
- use the sample bank editor to import all the files
- compile bank (produces .wbk and .ptr). the first time this will ask you to specify a file path but subsequently will just update the existing file
- open sound effects editor
- 'auto create', add all files
- 'load/save' > binary n64 sound effects (produces .bfx)
