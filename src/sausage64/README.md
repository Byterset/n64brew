# Sausage64 Sample Library

This library contains a single .c and .h file which you can drag and drop into your N64 project in order to have support for Sausage64 models converted by the [Sample Parser](../Sample%20Parser) tool. It is designed for both Libultra and Libdragon (using OpenGL).

In order to use the library with Libdragon, make sure you uncomment the `#define LIBDRAGON` to enable Libdragon support. The API changes slightly between both versions, so please double check below what functions you are supposed to be using.

The library is, currently, very basic. It can be expanded in the future in order to add more features, such as animation speed and blending. 

With this implementation of the library, matrix transformations are done on the CPU in order to reduce the memory footprint. This does mean that the CPU will be doing a bit more work, but that will probably not be too much of a problem given that most games are fillrate limited. Animations are also expected to playback at 30 frames per second.

A tutorial on how to use the library is available [in the wiki](../../../wiki/5%29-Sample-library-tutorial). You also have an example implementation available in the [Sample ROM](../Sample%20ROM) folder.
